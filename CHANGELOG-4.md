## [v4.0.0] - 2018-04-02

Biggest change of this release is moving from mixture of Yaml and Neon format in `*.neon` files to Yaml format in `*.yaml` files. That will make Symplify packages more world-friendly and standard rather than Czech-only Neon format. See [#651](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/651) about more reasoning behind this.

This change was finished in [Statie](https://github.com/symplify/statie) and [EasyCodingStandard](https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard), where mostly requested.

### Removed

#### Statie

- [#647] Removed deprecated `vendor/bin/statie push-to-github` command, use [Github pages on Travis](https://www.statie.org/docs/github-pages/#allow-travis-to-make-changes) instead
- [#647] Removed deprecated `parameters > github_repository_slug` option, use `github_repository_source_directory` instead
    ```diff
     # statie.yml
     parameters:
    -    # <user>/<repository>
    -    github_repository_slug: "pehapkari/pehapkari.cz"
    +    # https://github.com/<user>/<repository>/tree/master/<source>, where <source> is name of directory with Statie content
    +    github_repository_source_directory: "https://github.com/pehapkari/pehapkari.cz/tree/master/source"
    ```
- [#647] Removed deprecated `statie.neon` note, use `statie.yml` instead

#### PackageBuilder

- [#720] Removed `Symplify\PackageBuilder\Console\Style\SymfonyStyleFactory`, that was only for exception rendering; use `Symplify\PackageBuilder\Console\ExceptionRenderer` instead
- [#651] Removed `Symplify\PackageBuilder\Neon\Loader\NeonLoader` and `Symplify\PackageBuilder\Neon\NeonLoaderAwareKernelTrait`, that attempted to put Neon into Symfony Kernel, very poorly though; Yaml and Symfony DI is now used insteads

#### EasyCodingStandard

- [#712] Removed `Symplify\EasyCodingStandard\Testing\AbstractContainerAwareCheckerTestCase`, use `Symplify\EasyCodingStandardTester\Testing\AbstractCheckerTestCase` instead
- [#647] Removed deprecated bin files: `vendor/bin/easy-coding-standard` and `vendor/bin/easy-coding-standard.php`; use `vendor/bin/ecs` instead
- [#693] Removed `AbstractSimpleFixerTestCase` in favor of more general and advanced `AbstractContainerAwareCheckerTestCase`

#### CodingStandard

- [#708] Removed `AnnotateMagicContainerGetterFixer`, use awesome [Symfony Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7219-symfony-plugin) instead
- [#688] Removed `DynamicPropertySniff`, use `PHPStan\Rules\Properties\AccessPropertiesRule`  PHPStan with [`--level 0`](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/blob/3485d8ce8c64a6becf6cc60f268d051af6ff7ceb/conf/config.level0.neon#L28) instead
- [#647] Removed deprecated `LastPropertyAndFirstMethodSeparationFixer`, see [#594], use [`PhpCsFixer\Fixer\ClassNotation\ClassAttributesSeparationFixer`](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/b7cc8727c7faa8ebe7cc4220daaaabe29751bc5c/src/Fixer/ClassNotation/ClassAttributesSeparationFixer.php) instead; extends it if you need different space count
- [#647] Removed deprecated `Symplify\CodingStandard\Fixer\Strict\InArrayStrictFixer`, use [`PhpCsFixer\Fixer\Strict\StrictParamFixer`](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/b7cc8727c7faa8ebe7cc4220daaaabe29751bc5c/src/Fixer/Strict/StrictParamFixer.php) instead, that does the same job
- [#749] Removed `BreakMethodArgumentsFixer`, `BreakArrayListFixer`, use `Symplify\CodingStandard\Fixer\LineLength\LineLengthFixer` instead
